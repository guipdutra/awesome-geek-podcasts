# Contributing

Your contributions are always welcome!

## Content Guidelines

* Edit `README.md` to add content, but don't mess with the [YAML Front Matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/), which is used to publish to the github.io site.
* Add section if needed.
    * Add section description.
    * Add section title to Table of contents.
* Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Add your links: `* [project-name](http://example.com/) - A short description ends with a dot.`
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
* Send a pull request.

## Website Info

The site is published via [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). If you are the ambitious dev who chooses to design the site, you can work on it locally via the following instructions. The site will then be accessible at `localhost:4000`

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ''
```
